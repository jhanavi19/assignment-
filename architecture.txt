Documentation on architecture and design as architecture:

Java Architecture is a collection of components, i.e., JVM, JRE, and JDK. It integrates the process of interpretation and compilation. It defines all the processes involved in creating a Java program. Java Architecture explains each and every step of how a program is compiled and executed.
Java Architecture can be explained by using the following steps:
o	There is a process of compilation and interpretation in Java.
o	Java compiler converts the Java code into byte code.
o	After that, the JVM converts the byte code into machine code.
o	The machine code is then executed by the machine.
The following figure represents the Java Architecture in which each step is elaborate graphically.

 
Components of Java Architecture
The Java architecture includes the three main components:
o	Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
o	Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
o	Java Development Kit (JDK)


Requirements
1. To start the program: run java urldatabase. Further, the program will wait for the user to enter the following
commands.
2. The command storeurl shall take a URL as a parameter and save that into a table with a unique short key and a
count(usage count) initialized to 0.
a. Use local variables instead of a database to store the data.
b. Use any appropriate logic to generate the unique short key.
3. The command get shall take a URL as a parameter and return the unique short key after incrementing the usage
count.
4. The command count shall take a URL as a parameter and should return the latest usage count.
5. The command list should return all urls and counts. The return value is in JSON.
6. The command exit should terminate the program
Example Commands usage
1. To start the program: run java urldatabase.
2. Commands:
a. storeurl google.com
b. get google.com
c. count google.com
d. list
3. To exit the program enter exit
